Reply to All Unsubscribe

Tired of getting reply-to-all emails on a thread you never even asked for? Then make a new mail rule to run this apple script. Every time the script runs it will reply to all with the message, "unsubscribe."

Future Work
1. Add ability to shuffle not just one word at a time, but in groups of two, three, maybe four words at a time. This'll help to further pollute information space for search terms of multiple words and simply by making more of its contents into gobbledygook and by making the reply message longer.
2. Add ability to reshuffle the message each of the multiple times the script replies per execution.
