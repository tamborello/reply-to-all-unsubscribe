Reply to All Unsubscribe

Tired of getting reply-to-all emails on a thread you never even asked for? Then make a new mail rule to run this apple script. Every time the script runs it will reply to all with the message, "unsubscribe."

Future Work
1. The data reading subroutine will fail if that file doesn't exist. Add a check and creation functionality for that case.
2. Add ability to shuffle not just one word at a time, but in groups of two, three, maybe four words at a time. This'll help to further pollute information space for search terms of multiple words and simply by making more of its contents into gobbledygook just by making the reply message longer.
